# What is Heracles?

This repository provides a library for encoding a
[Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra) 3D scene graph into a Neo4j
database. It expects a scene graph to initially be loaded from file via
[spark\_dsg](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Spark-DSG) and provides utilities for
translating back and forth between spark\_dsg and the Neo4j database.

If you are interested in using Heracles within an agentic framework, please check out our related repository [heracles_agents](https://github.com/goldenZephyr/heracles_agents). Heracles has been used as part of an LLM agentic framework for answering questions about the scene graph and grounding instructions to Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) goals for robot planning. Please see our paper "[Structured Interfaces for Automated Reasoning with 3D Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16643)".

To try out Heracles, we provide three examples that should be pretty easy to run. They require that
Docker is installed, but they should have no other dependencies.

## Minimal Example

To run the first example, run
```bash
./heracles_demo.sh
```

This script will load an example scene graph into the graph database and put
you in a python terminal where you can run example queries. For example, try
running the following query to print the location of all trashcans:
```python
db.query("MATCH (n: Object {class: 'trash'}) RETURN n.center as center""")
```

## Interactive ROS Example

The second example will render the current state of the scene graph in the
database in Rviz. You do _not_ need ROS installed to run this demo. However,
you will need to specify an OpenAI api key `HERACLES_OPENAI_API_KEY` if you
want to use the LLM interaction functionality.

```bash
export HERACLES_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI API KEY>
xhost +local:docker && ./chatdsg_ros_demo.sh
```

Try asking the LLM how many objects are in the scene graph (press `ctrl-b` to
send your message to the LLM). Then try telling it to update some of the
objects (e.g., turn `sign`s into `light`s).

## Interactive Viser Example

Finally, we provide an example of visualizing the scene graph using Viser, so
that no ROS is necessary. Again, you will need an OpenAI API key if you want to
use the LLM functionality. Make sure to go to http://127.0.0.1:8081 in your
browser after running the script!

```bash
export HERACLES_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI API KEY>
./chatdsg_viser_demo.sh # Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 in your browser
```

You may have to pan the camera around if the scene graph is rendered out of the
initial camera frame.


# Development Setup

If you want functionality beyond these basic demos, you will want to install
`heracles` locally. This requires 1) spinning up a database, and 2) installing
`heracles.

Pull the Neo4j database image:
```bash
docker pull neo4j:5.25.1
```

Run the database:
```bash
docker run -d \
   --restart always \
   --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
   --env=NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/neo4j_pw \
   neo4j:5.25.1
```

Clone and install this repo:
```bash
git@github.com:GoldenZephyr/heracles.git
cd heracles
pip install .
```

If you run into installation problems, check `.github/workflows/ci-action.yml`
for an example, as that successfully installs and runs the library for CI.

If you don't have a scene graph to test with, you can use a large example scene
graph [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aktyS792PUrj2ACRu1DoxMGse55GWloB/view?usp=drive_link).
This scene graph has 2D places and objects, and 3D places (that don't make much
sense), but no regions or rooms. This repo contains an example scene graph as well.

## Demo - Loading a Scene Graph
We provide a demo program that loads a scene graph from file, encodes it into a
database, and performs a simple query for validation. The demo program is
implemented with interactive mode in mind to make it easy to try other kinds of
queries.

### Environment Variables
We expect certain environment variables to be set, listed below. `HERACLES\_NEO4J\_URI` can alternatively be provided via the command line. An example of `HERACLES\_NEO4J\_URI` is `neo4j://127.0.0.1:7688`.

| Environment Variable Name         | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HERACLES\_NEO4J\_USERNAME         | Username of local Neo4j graph database                                     |
| HERACLES\_NEO4J\_PASSWORD         | Password of local Neo4j graph database                                     |
| HERACLES\_NEO4J\_URI              | Address for database (neo4j://IP:PORT)                                     |


### Run the program
To run the vanilla demo (load a scene graph and print a summary):
```bash
cd heracles/examples/
./load_scene_graph.py
```

The demo is useful to run in interactive mode. We leave the DB connection open, so it is possible to easily try other queries.
To run the program in interactive mode:
```bash
cd heracles/examples/
python -i load_scene_graph.py
```
The demo should run as normal but end in an active interactive mode. You can immediately try another query. For example:
```bash
db.query("MATCH (n: Object) RETURN DISTINCT n.class as class, COUNT(*) as count")
```

## Heracles ROS

If you would like to use `heracles` with ROS, `heracles_ros` provides an
interface for publishing the scene graph from the graph database as a ROS
message. If you would like to use this functionality, you should clone this
repo in your ROS workspace. Instead of manually pip installing as described
above, you can let `colcon` take care of the installation (as long as your
virtual environment is created with `--system-site-packages`). If you also have
[Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra-ROS/tree/main) installed, you can
visualize the scene graph that's in the graph database with the following
command:

```bash
ros2 launch heracles_ros demo.launch.yaml launch_heracles_publisher:=true launch_hydra_visualizer:=true launch_rviz:=true
```

## Useful Queries


### Print distinct object classes in scene graph

```python
db.query("MATCH (n: Object) RETURN DISTINCT n.class as class""")
```

### Print distinct object classes and counts
```python
db.query("MATCH (n: Object) RETURN DISTINCT n.class as class, COUNT(*) as count""")
```

### Print center point of objects of specific class
```python
db.query("MATCH (n: Object {class: 'tree'}) RETURN n.center as center""")
```

### Filter for objects of a certain type within a bounding box
```python
db.query("""WITH point({x: -100, y: 16, z: -100}) AS lowerLeft,
                 point({x: -90, y: 22, z:100}) AS upperRight
            MATCH (t: Object {class: "tree"})
            WHERE point.withinBBox(t.center, lowerLeft, upperRight)
            RETURN t as result""")
```

### Filter for all objects of a certain type within 30 meters of given point
```python
db.query(""" MATCH (t: Object {class: "tree"})
             WITH point.distance(point({x: -100, y:16, z:0}), t.center) as d, t
             WHERE d < 30
             RETURN t as obj, d as distance""")
```

### Get all 2D places within 5 hops of given place

For graph-based reasoning with larger neighborhoods, there are some special
built-in graph search algorithms that will be more performant that these
general cypher queries. For example, for connected-component queries, you
probably want to use [the graph-data-science
plugin](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/wcc/)
```python
db.query(""" MATCH (p: MeshPlace {nodeSymbol: "P(1832)"})
             MATCH path=(p)-[:MESH_PLACE_CONNECTED *1..5]->(c: MeshPlace)
             RETURN DISTINCT c.nodeSymbol as ns
             ORDER BY c.nodeSymbol
         """)
```

### Create a Room

Potentially useful for directly modifying data with LLM-generated prompt. For a
more robust but less general way of adding nodes see `graph_interface.py`.

```python
db.query("""WITH point({x: -95, y: 15, z: 0}) as center
            CREATE (:Room {nodeSymbol: "R(1)", center: center,  class: "test_room"})""")
```

### Connect place near room to room

```python
db.query("""WITH point({x: -120, y: 0, z: -100}) AS lowerLeft,
                 point({x: -70, y: 30, z:100}) AS upperRight
            MATCH (p: Place)
            MATCH (r: Room {nodeSymbol: "R(1)"})
            WHERE point.withinBBox(p.center, lowerLeft, upperRight)
            CREATE (r)-[:CONTAINS]->(p)
            """)
```

### Query for objects in Room

Based on *explicit* structure of Room -> Place -> Object
```python
db.query("""MATCH (r: Room {nodeSymbol: "R(1)"})-[:CONTAINS]->(p: Place)-[:CONTAINS]->(o: Object)
            RETURN o""")
```

Based on implicit / transitive structure of hierarchical relationships:
```python
db.query("""MATCH (r: Room {nodeSymbol: "R(1)"})-[:CONTAINS*]->(o: Object)
            RETURN o""")
```
